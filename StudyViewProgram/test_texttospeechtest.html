    <p id='txtInput'>Description: Skin is the largest organ in the body and covers the body's entire external surface. 
        It is made up of three layers, the epidermis, dermis, and the hypodermis, all three of which vary 
        significantly in their anatomy and function. The skin's structure is made up of an intricate network 
        which serves as the body’s initial barrier against pathogens, UV light, and chemicals, and mechanical 
        injury. It also regulates temperature and the amount of water released into the environment. This article 
        discusses the relevant anatomical structures of the skin’s epidermal layer, its structure, function, embryology,
         vascular supply, innervation, surgical considerations, and clinical relevance.</p>
